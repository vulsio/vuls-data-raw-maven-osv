	"summary": "Denial of service vulnerability on creating a Launch with too many recursively nested elements in reportportal",
	"details": "### Impact\nReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path field is exceeded the allowable \"ltree\" field type indexing limit (path length>=120 approximately, recursive nesting of the nested steps). \n\nREINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't helped. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem was fixed in `service-api` module of version `5.10.0` (product release [23.2](https://reportportal.io/docs/releases/Version23.2/)), where the maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited.\n\n### Workarounds\nAfter deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx), the database becomes stable and ReportPortal is working properly.",
