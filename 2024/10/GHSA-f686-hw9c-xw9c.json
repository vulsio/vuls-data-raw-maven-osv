	"summary": "Snowflake JDBC Security Advisory",
	"details": "### Impacted Products\nSnowflake JDBC driver versions >= 3.2.6 & <= 3.19.1 are affected.\n\n### Introduction\nSnowflake recently identified an issue affecting JDBC drivers that can result in data being uploaded to an encrypted stage without the additional layer of protection provided by client side encryption. The issue, which affects only a subset of accounts hosted on Azure and GCP deployments (AWS deployments are not affected), manifests in instances where customers create a stage using a JDBC driver with the CLIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_SIZE account parameter set to 256-bit rather than the default 128-bit. The data is still protected by TLS in transit and server side encryption at rest. This missed layer of the additional protection is not visible to the affected customers.\n\n### Incorrect Security Setting Vulnerability \n#### Description\nSnowflake identified an incorrect security setting in Snowflake JDBC drivers. Snowflake has evaluated the severity of the issue and determined it was in medium range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 5.9. \n#### Scenarios and attack vector(s)\nUsers of Snowflake JDBC drivers with accounts on Azure and GCP deployments who set the parameter CLIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_SIZE = 256 were subject to this incorrect security setting vulnerability as it could result in data being uploaded to a stage without an additional layer for encryption. \n#### Our response\nOn July 23, 2024, Snowflake discovered this vulnerability. On 10/28/2024, Snowflake released a patch in Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.20.0. The patch fixes the incorrect security setting. \n#### Resolution\nWe strongly recommend users to upgrade to 3.20.0 or later versions as soon as possible. \n\n### Contact\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team).\n",
