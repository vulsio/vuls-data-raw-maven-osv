	"summary": "biscuit-java vulnerable to public key confusion in third party block",
	"details": "### Impact\nTokens with third-party blocks containing trusted annotations generated through a third party block request. Due to implementation issues in biscuit-java,  third party block support in published versions is inoperating. Nevertheless, to synchronize with other implementations, we publish this advisory and the related fix.\n\n### Description\nThird-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it:\n\nthe public key of the previous block (used in the signature)\nthe public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions)\nA third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.\n\nConsider the following example (nominal case)\n* Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty(\"b\") trusting ${pubkeyB}`\n* The well-behaving holder then generates a third-party block request based on the token and sends it to third-party authority B\n* Third-party B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyC}`\n* The token holder now must obtain a third-party block from third party C to be able to use the token\n\nNow, with a malicious user:\n* Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty(\"b\") trusting ${pubkeyB}`\n* The holder then attenuates the token with the following third party block `thirdparty(\"c\")`, signed with a keypair pubkeyD, privkeyD) they generate\n* The holder then generates a third-party block request based on this token, but alter the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` publicKeys field and replace pubkeyD with pubkeyC\n* Third-party B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyC}`\n* Due to the altered symbol table, the actual meaning of the block is `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyD}`\n* The attacker can now use the token without obtaining a third-party block from C.",
