	"summary": "Authentication Bypass For Endpoints With Anonymous Access in Opencast",
	"details": "### Impact\n\nUsing a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary username can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access.\n\nThis way, an attacker can, for example, fake a remember-me token, assume the identity of the global system administrator and request non-public content from the search service without ever providing any proper authentication.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround for older, unpatched versions, disabling remember-me cookies in `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` will mitigate the problem but will obviously also disable this feature without obvious indication. To deactivate this, remove the following line from the security configuration:\n\n```xml\n<sec:remember-me â€¦ />\n```\n\n### References\n\n- [Remember-me cookie in the security configuration file](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/blob/161ee619382f144dc35eea211fc6b556025b98e1/etc/security/mh_default_org.xml#L335-L336)\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in [opencast/opencast](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n- For security-relevant information, email us at security@opencast.org",
