Please see the issue [here](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/304#issuecomment-1293654236) for more information.\n\n## Original Despcription \n\nThose using FasterXML/woodstox to serialise XML data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by stack overflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is only relevant for users making use of the DTD parsing functionality. ",
