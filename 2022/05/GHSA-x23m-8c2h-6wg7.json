This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nThis is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1598](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598).\n\nRedgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.5 now stores the API key encrypted. Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.",
