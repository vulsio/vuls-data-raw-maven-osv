	"details": "Jenkins Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
