	"summary": "Jenkins WebSphere Deployer Plugin missing permission check",
	"details": "Jenkins WebSphere Deployer Plugin 1.6.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins controller file system, and obtain limited information about the Jenkins and plugin configuration based on the responses. The latter include the ability to set plugin configuration options.\n\nAdditionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
