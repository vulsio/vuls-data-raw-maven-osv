	"details": "Jenkins AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin stored username and password in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' config.xml files on the Jenkins controller. This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nWhile masked from view using a password form field, the password was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.\n\nAppDynamics Dashboard Plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text. Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.",
